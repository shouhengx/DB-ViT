# Double-Branch Vision Transformer (DB-ViT)
This is the code of the hyperspectral image classification network: Double-Branch Vision Transformer (DB-ViT).
The datasets required for the code can be found at http://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php/Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Scenes or http://dase.grss-ieee.org/.

Now we have shown the backbone of the code, the details of which will be published after the paper __*Double-Branch Vision Transformer for Spatial-Spectral Feature Learning in Hyperspectral Image Classification*__ is accepted.
